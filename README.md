## About The Project

An old project named <a href="https://github.com/cmdrflexo/RocketFOSS">RocketFoss</a> has been abandoned so ive decided to carry the torch of opensource, and just build a fun game.

**Defeat the enemies home base to win.** The concept is simple and allows for multiplayer. Nbody orbital mechanics "no pached conics". Combat will be similar to "Children of a dying star" but more reliant on skill. large but simple scope, World, weapons, and a way to get around.
